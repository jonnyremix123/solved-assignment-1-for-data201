Dowload LifeExpectancy.csv from the course webpage, and read it into Python, skipping the necessary rows and reading the header. Make the country name be an index. Print the first few rows to ensure that you have it correct. [2 marks]In [2]:

Be careful how you do this, the naive way of just using dropna() without looking at the data a bit might not do what you expect. You might need to know that to delete a column you can use life.drop([list of column names],axis=1 . [2 marks]In [3]:

Now plot the curves of life expectancy against time on 1 plot for the following countries:Afghanistan, Nepal, New Zealand, Netherlands Include a legend, and make the labels on the x-axis readable. [2 marks] In [4]:

Plot Rwanda separately, and explain briefly why it has that shape (hint: use wikipedia) [2 marks]In [5]:

Can you detect any other countries where the life expectancy drops significantly?To compute this write some loops over each country and each year. If the next value is below 95% of the current value, print the name of the country. [4 marks]In [6]:

Plot a bar chart of this for the first 10 countries. [4 marks]

Find the 5 countries with the highest mean life expectancy and the 5 with the lowest. You might find life.sort_values() helpful, as well as pd.concat and life.transpose . Plot a box and whisker plot of these countries. [4 marks]
